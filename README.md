# Data visualization

## Presentation

Here is my realization for the front-end test. The back-end is in the _api_ folder and based on Express/Node. The front-end is in the _front_ folder, the react app was initialized with npx create-react-app.

To create the graphs, I chose the React chart library **nivo** as it is easy to use, allows customization and provides a large range of dataviz components. The documentation is often updated and a large and active community uses this library.

## Setup

You will need npm to run the project.

For each application,you can install dependencies like so:

```bash
npm install
```

You can then run both of the apps with the following:

```bash
npm start
```
